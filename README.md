# SAV_TAVR_DCI
Variation in Outcomes between SAVR and TAVR for the Distressed and non Distressed Population 

This analysis is focused on exploring the variation in outcomes between surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), for the distressed and non-distressed populations. 

Detailed univariate analysis was performed, and all analysis was performed in STATA and R. For more comparative analysis the SAVR and TAVR groups were matched using propensity score matching technique. 

This analysis was performed by linking Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State level (HCUP SID) data with Distressed Communities index data set  the Year 2012-2015. ICD9 codes were used to capture the primary procedure. Access to data is subject to a Data Use Agreement and authorization, all the authors on this project have authorization to utilize this data set for research purposes.

We have made sure that all the analysis is thoroughly reviewed to be error free, furthermore all the results have been hidden that may lead back to tracing individual identities. All the coding steps involved in linking, cleaning, and preparing the data for analysis and modeling have been listed below with the name of each file. Code for all steps involved in cleaning, linking, preprocessing, propensity matching and modeling has been shared.
